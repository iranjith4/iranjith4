# Hey there! 👋 I'm Ranjith

## 🧙‍♂️ iOS Wizard with 10+ Years of Swift Sorcery

Currently conjuring up mobile magic at **Radius Agent** as Technical Lead, where I turn caffeine into code and bugs into features (well, most of the time 😅).

### 🚀 What I Do When I'm Not Debugging

- 📱 **Mobile Architect**: Building apps that don't crash (revolutionary concept, I know)
- 👥 **Team Mentor**: Teaching developers the ancient art of clean code and the modern art of not crying during code reviews
- 🍎 **Apple Ecosystem Devotee**: Inspired by Steve Jobs' innovation at Apple - been crafting iOS magic ever since the first iPhone changed everything

### 🛠️ My Toolkit of Wonder

```swift
let mySkills = [
    "Languages": ["Swift", "Objective-C", "Lua"],
    "Frameworks": ["SwiftUI", "UIKit", "Combine", "TCA", "RxSwift"],
    "Databases": ["CoreData", "Realm", "Firebase"],
    "Cloud": ["AWS Amplify", "Because servers need love too"],
    "Design": ["Figma", "Adobe XD", "Making things look less ugly"],
    "Tools": ["Xcode", "Instruments", "CI/CD", "Git", "Coffee Machine"]
]
```

### ✈️ When I'm Not Coding

- 🛫 **Aviation Enthusiast**: Fascinated by planes and airports (yes, I'm that person who arrives 3 hours early just to plane-spot)
- 🌍 **Travel Addict**: Always planning the next adventure
- 🏎️ **F1 Fan**: Watching cars go vroom vroom at 300 km/h (way faster than my build times)
- 🤿 **Underwater Explorer**: Recently went scuba diving in the Maldives with my wifee (fish are surprisingly good at code reviews)

- 📸 **Photography**: Capturing moments when I'm not capturing bugs

### 🏆 Random Achievements That Sound Impressive

- 🥇 **Hackathon Winner**: Beat other sleep-deprived developers at Perk.com hackathon
- 🚀 **Incubation Survivor**: Made it through TATA ELXSI & NASSCOM programs (with sanity mostly intact)
- 🌟 **Facebook Start Alumni**: Back when Facebook was just Facebook
- 🏅 **National Rank Holder**: Unified Cyber Olympiad (yes, I was that kid)

### 🌟 Fun Facts About Me

- Built an SDK used by **500K+ developers** (no pressure, right?)
- Contributed to open-source projects because sharing is caring 💝
- Can make gyroscopes and accelerometers do my bidding
- Still remember when Objective-C was a thing (kids these days...)
